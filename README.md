There is a project outline for constraints and 6 testing environments. The objective is to create an algorithm that leads the packages with minimum time steps.

A detailed report is written. I explained my thinking process during solution and paradigms used in implementation by giving code snippets. 

This project report was uploaded for ASU Computer Science Msc course Knowledge Representation and Reasoning.
